# Chapter 3: Log-regression

### Preliminary actions

Let's first read the data from a local folder and print out the column names. This file has data on student alcohol consumption, descriptive variables, and most importantly number of absences and final grade (G3 - from 0 to 20). We will analyse the relatinship between alcohol consumption (binary variable high_use) to other variables (G3 test grade, mothers education, gender, and absences). Hypothesis: i) from previous studies the mothers educational background usually has had a good explanatory strength in the performance/behavior of their children. Furthermore, ii) males tend to drink more, iii) and absences captures the "dropout" behavior in the data. iv) Low test performance likely affects (and other way as well) tendency to drink because students are, in lack of other words, demoralized or simply sad. v) Freetime and goout measure the reported 'boredom' or neglect of coursework as well as amount of socializing of the students.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
summarise(group_by(alc, high_use), testin_k_arvo = mean(G3), testin_hajonta = sd(G3))
tarkasteltavat_muuttujat <- c("high_use","G3","Medu","sex","absences","freetime","goout")
data <- select(alc, one_of(tarkasteltavat_muuttujat))
glimpse(data)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
gather(data) %>% ggplot(aes(value)) + facet_wrap("key", scales = "free") +geom_bar()

```

Next we check the frequencies of high usage among different sexes  and variables: grades (G3), absences, and Mothers education. We also plot boxplots to check the distribution among these subgroups.


```{r}
library(dplyr)
data %>% group_by(sex,high_use) %>% summarise(count = n(),mean_grade = mean(G3))
ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = G3, col=sex)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab("grade") + ggtitle("High Alcohol Usage and Test Performance")

data %>% group_by(sex,high_use) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_absences = mean(absences))
ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = absences, col=sex)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab("absences") + ggtitle("High Alcohol Usage and absences")

data %>% group_by(sex,high_use) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_mothersEdu = mean(Medu))
ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = Medu, col=sex)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab("Mothers Education") + ggtitle("High Alcohol Usage and Mothers Education")

data %>% group_by(sex,high_use) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_freetime = mean(freetime))
  ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = freetime, col=sex)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab("Freetime") + ggtitle("High Alcohol Usage and freetime")
  
  data %>% group_by(sex,high_use) %>% summarise(count = n(), mean_goout = mean(goout))
  ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = goout, col=sex)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab("Spend time with friends") + ggtitle("High Alcohol Usage and Going out")
```

It appears that test performance is lowe especially for men for high users of alcohol. Similar effect can be found for absences; high users of acohol are more likely to miss classes, especially for men. We did not find a clear difference based on Mothers education (our initial hypothesis seems to have been wrong) and therefore change our attention to freetime. High users seem to have more freetime, this might be due to neglect of work or just plain boredom. Similarly, individuals which are more social or have less preference to study tend to be higher drinkers.

### The model

Next we fit a logistic model to explain high usage of alcohol. Our model is the following 

> high_use ~ freetime + absences + sex + goout

```{r}
# find the model with glm()
m <- glm(high_use ~ freetime + absences + sex + goout, data = alc, family = "binomial")

# print out a summary of the model
summary(m)

# print out the coefficients of the model
coef(m)

#ODDS ratio of 1/6, individual is 1/6 likely to succeed with X, the exponent of the coefficients: exp(beta) = odds(Y|x+1)/odds(Y|x)

# compute odds ratios (OR)
OR <- coef(m) %>% exp

# compute confidence intervals (CI)
CI <- confint(m) %>% exp

# print out the odds ratios with their confidence intervals
cbind(OR, CI)
```

When goout (spending time with friends) is included in the model it seems that freetime does not have explanatory power in the model. From the print above, one can see that amount of absences, gender, and social activity seem to explain alcohol usage quite well. For example, an individual answering that they spend more time with friends (Likert scale) are twice as likely to use high amounts of alcohol, everything else held constant. Likewise, males are much more likely to spend more alcohol and students who are absent have a small risk factor. Note that freetime is not signifficant at p-value 10% (or 5%) and the confidence interwal includes 1 for odds ratios, which means that the model suggest that there is no clear causality weather students whom spend more freetime have a higher or lower risk to consume high amounts of alchol. The results show that the initial hypothesis on social behaviour, gender, and amount absences seem to be correct but ones on Mothers education (based on the graph above) or freetime spent were not.

### Validation

Now we try to make predictions and cross-validation based on the model used.

```{r}
# find the model with glm()
m <- glm(high_use ~ freetime + absences + sex + goout, data = alc, family = "binomial")

# predict() the probability of high_use
probabilities <- predict(m, type = "response")

# add the predicted probabilities to 'alc'
alc <- mutate(alc, probability = probabilities)

# use the probabilities to make a prediction of high_use
alc <- mutate(alc, prediction = probability > 0.5)

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction)

# initialize a plot of 'high_use' versus 'probability' in 'alc'
g <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = probability, y = high_use, col=prediction))

# define the geom as points and draw the plot
g + geom_point()

# tabulate the target variable versus the predictions
table(high_use = alc$high_use, prediction = alc$prediction) %>% prop.table %>% addmargins()

# define a loss function (mean prediction error)
loss_func <- function(class, prob) {
  n_wrong <- abs(class - prob) > 0.5
  mean(n_wrong)
}

# call loss_func to compute the average number of wrong predictions in the (training) data
loss_func(class = alc$high_use, prob = alc$probability)


# K-fold cross-validation
library(boot)
cv <- cv.glm(data = alc, cost = loss_func, glmfit = m, K = 10)

# average number of wrong predictions in the cross validation
cv$delta[1]
```

Based on the definition of high users our model estimates that 64 individuals would not be high users when infact they were, 18 would be high users when they were not and 50 where 'correcly' identified as high users. This is also shown in a graph with predictions as real values. Table shows the probabilities that the model is either correct or incorrect (type I and type II errors can be easily calculated from this). Noteworthy is that the loss function is lower (0.21) than the baseline (0.26), which suggests that our model seems to work better than the baseline model of including failures, absence and sex as explanatory variables. This is also the training error.
